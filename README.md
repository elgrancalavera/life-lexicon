LIFE LEXICON
  Release 25, 2006 February 28
  ASCII version

INTRODUCTION
  This is a lexicon of terms relating to John Horton Conway's
Game of Life.  It is also available in single-page and multipage
HTML versions.
  This lexicon was compiled by Stephen A. Silver - see
below for additional credits.  I can be contacted at
life(at)argentum.freeserve.co.uk.
  The latest versions of this lexicon (both HTML and ASCII)
should be available from the Life Lexicon Home Page at
http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm.

CREDITS
  The largest single source for the early versions of this lexicon was
a glossary compiled by Alan Hensel "with indispensable help from John
Conway, Dean Hickerson, David Bell, Bill Gosper, Bob Wainwright, Noam
Elkies, Nathan Thompson, Harold McIntosh, and Dan Hoey".
  Other sources include the works listed in the bibliography at the
end of this lexicon, as well as pattern collections by Alan Hensel and
David Bell (and especially Dean Hickerson's file stamp.l in the latter
collection), and the web sites of Mark Niemiec, Paul Callahan, Achim
Flammenkamp, Robert Wainwright and Heinrich Koenig.  Recent releases
also use a lot of information from Dean Hickerson's header to his
1995 stamp file (http://math.ucdavis.edu/~dean/RLE/stamps.html).
  Most of the information on recent results is from the discoverers
themselves.
  The following people all provided useful comments on earlier releases
of this lexicon: David Bell, Nicolay Beluchenko, Johan Bontes, Scot
Ellison, Nick Gotts, Dave Greene, Alan Hensel, Dean Hickerson, Dieter
Leithner, Mark Niemiec, Gabriel Nivasch, Andrzej Okrasinski, Peter Rott,
Tony Smith, Ken Takusagawa, Andrew Trevorrow and Malcolm Tyrrell.
  The format, errors, use of British English and anything else you
might want to complain about are by Stephen Silver.
